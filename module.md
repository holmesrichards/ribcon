# Ribbon controller module

A Kosmo module version of the interface would be a good idea. 

A simple module would be dac/ino based, with:

- 3.5 mm TRS jack for ribbon
- 1/4" jacks for CVs and gate
- Pots for range and offset

With the standard dac/ino the full range could be up to 10 V, maybe 5 V would be better. Using offset this could be zero centered or zero at one end (or the other...). Zero centering would make the ribbon more useful as a modulation controller.

Maybe the module itself could have a small SoftPot on the panel, with a switch to select it versus plug-in ribbon. (Spectra Symbol lengths are: 12.5, 25\*, 50\*, 100\*, 150\*, 170, 200\*, 300, 400\*, 500\*, 750\*, 1000\* mm. SparkFun version cheaper, 50\*, 200\*, 500\* mm. \* = Mouser stocked. 50 or 100 mm probably best choice.)
